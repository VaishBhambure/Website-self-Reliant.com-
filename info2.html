				<h2>St.John's Medical College</h2>
				<P class="text"> The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) established St. John’s Medical College in Bengaluru in 1963 with the aim of training healthcare personnel committed to serving the poor in the margins. It was dedicated as a memorial of the XXXVIII International Eucharistic Congress held in Bombay in 1964 and named after St. John the Baptist, the Patron of the Pope John XXIII, who was an ardent supporter of this initiative of the Catholic Church in India.</p>
